Existentialists taught us to write as if every sentence mattered. Letter writing refines that demand. When we draft notes to a future self, we cut through performance. We describe the dilemmas that persist when the audience disappears. The practice is humble and editorial: summarise the present faithfully so tomorrow can respond.

I keep a ledger of questions rather than answers. Which values felt negotiable this week? Which friendships carried meaning even in silence? By tracing the contours of our days, we rehearse responsibility. We cannot predict the future, but we can leave margins filled with breadcrumbs.

The journal, then, is not a confession booth. It is a newsroom for the self. We report without embellishment, trusting that the eventual reader—the later version of us—will interpret, critique, and perhaps revise the headline.
