Every opening repertoire is an autobiography disguised as theory. The Najdorf announces ambition. The London mumbles its intentions but never forgets its structure. Playing the same first moves over months is less about surprise than continuity: you are refining a thesis about where the middlegame conversation should happen.

Writers keep commonplace books to catalogue sentences worth borrowing. Players should do the same with positions. Collect miniature endings, model exchanges, rook lifts that feel like plot twists. Over time, the repertoire becomes a curated anthology. You are not memorising moves; you are rehearsing arguments.

Treat preparation like editing. Remove the lines that no longer sound like you. Keep the variations that invite you to think rather than merely recall. A personal opening repertoire is a promise to meet the board on terms you have already explored in quiet rooms.
