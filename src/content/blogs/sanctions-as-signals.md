Sanctions rarely change behaviour on their own. What they change is tempo. They slow transactions, they buy time, they test the patience of elites who assumed the status quo would persist. Policymakers stage them like theatre to communicate resolve to allies who fear drifting commitments.

The puzzle is one of calibration. Symbolic sanctions erode credibility; overreaching sanctions collapse coordination. Effective regimes feel proportionate, cumulative, and narrated. They are accompanied by speeches, leaks, and quiet reassurances to third parties who must cooperate.

If we are to analyse sanctions seriously, we must look at the surrounding discourse: which industries receive carve-outs, which jurisdictions play host to enforcement roadshows, which supply chains rewire themselves during the pause. The signal is never merely economicâ€”it is editorial, intended for readers across capitals.
