Protocols describe who trusts whom, on what terms, and with which safeguards. When we design new ones—whether for secure messaging or civic ledgers—we are deciding how communities will negotiate doubt. The engineering may be elegant, but the impact is cultural.

Audits, transparency reports, and open-source repositories are not afterthoughts; they are editorial annotations that help others read the system. The goal is not to eliminate doubt but to give it structure. A protocol succeeds when its users can articulate why it deserves confidence.

Technology discourse should therefore borrow the language of institutions. Which roles exist to question? Who can veto? Where is the record kept, and who edits it? The answers reveal whether a protocol is a fleeting experiment or the foundation for shared futures.
