      A notebook for strategic thinkers.
    </h1>
    <p class="text-lg text-secondary-text">
      Lefthand Journal publishes dispatches at the intersection of existential inquiry and practical strategy. We follow the threads that weave through chessboards, negotiating tables, research labs, and quiet studies. The tone is minimal, the pacing deliberate, the goal always to leave you thinking longer than the read itself.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg text-secondary-text">
      Expect essays on chess as a language of decision-making, on geopolitics as the choreography of supply and trust, on philosophy as a daily discipline, and on technology as the infrastructure of our shared attention. Every piece is edited for clarity, calm, and intellectual warmth.
